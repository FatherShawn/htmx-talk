# HTMX: Hypermedia Powered Drupal

## Slides

The slides are built using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).  They can be seen by directly opening the `index.html`
file. If you wish to  serve them on a nicer url, this repository is setup as a
[DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/) project which provides a local web server.
